You are a 16 year-old boy named Kosuke Okumura, and you are a junior at Kyoto High Prepatory School.
It is 6:30 AM on a Tuesday morning, and you just woke up. You get out of your bed and go to
the bathroom to brush your teeth and shower. When you come back to your room, something is
different. There is a golden envelope with your name on it on your bed. You walk cautiously
towards your bed and slowly pick up the envelope. Curious, you open it and see a piece of
paper. It's a letter! It says:

"Dear Kosuke,

I am writing from the future to warn you gravely that the world is soon about to end.
In the year 2033, the Earth will be attacked by a powerful demon. This beast will bring
upon us mass destruction and annihilation. Many of your friends and family will die.
However, you have the power to prevent this from happening.

This demon manifested itself from the heart of a young woman, who happens to be one of the
girls who currently attends your school, Kyoto High Prepatory School. The demon resides in
her heart and gradually becomes more powerful as the girl ages. However, the demon can be
driven away by the most powerful force in the world . . . love.

Kosuke, you need to win the heart of this girl right now, otherwise the world as you know
it will cease to exist. Unfortunately, I don't know the name of this girl, but I can give
you some clues. This girl is in your class, has blonde hair, has green eyes, loves cosplaying
anime characters, and has a pair.

I hope you take on this heavy responsibility. The fate of mankind rests in your hand.

All the best,
Kosuke Okumura

P.S. Don't get rid of your Pikachu pajamas. I know you love them."

Since nobody knows you are thinking of throwing away your Pikachu pajamas, you believe that this
letter really is from the future. You narrow down the list of girls that fit the description from
the letter. The girl with the demon in her heart is either Eli Aize or Mei Temuri, and you must win
the hearts of one of them.

But what does he mean by she has a pair?

You won Mei's heart! The two of you continue to have a relationship and eventually get married...

One day in 2033, you and Mei are taking a walk in the park. All of a sudden, you hear a huge explosion. A large, black
demonic figure appears and soars above the buildings. The demon has the face of Eli, but soon Eli's face is engulfed in
darkness. The demon bellows and releases a furnace into all directions. You and Mei try to run, but its flames reach the
park and burn everything.
"Meeeeeiiiiii!!!!" You shout, burning in anguish.
"Kosuke, I love you!" Mei screams what would be her final words.
You watch the love of your life die, and you die next to her. Everyone dies in this merciless attack and Eartb becomes
nothing but ashes.
You have failed humanity.
